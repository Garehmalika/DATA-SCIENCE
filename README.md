# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## Project Description
In this project, I applied various data science techniques to predict whether the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. The objective of this prediction model is to help determine the cost of a rocket launch. This information can be valuable to alternate companies considering bidding against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

The project involves analyzing historical data on SpaceX launches and developing a machine learning model to predict the success of the first stage landing based on various launch parameters.

## Project Goals
- Predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or not.
- Analyze and process data related to Falcon 9 launches.
- Build and evaluate a machine learning model for classification.
- Provide insights into the factors that impact the success of the first stage landing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data on SpaceX launches, including parameters such as:
- Launch site
- Rocket configuration
- Launch success or failure
- First stage landing success or failure
- Other relevant features that affect the launch

The dataset can be found here: [SpaceX Launch Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/space-x/launch-data).

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for exploratory data analysis and model development.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection**: Obtained historical SpaceX launch data from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and processed the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature selection to choose the most relevant features for the model.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Split the data into training and test sets.
   - Built classification models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Used cross-validation to ensure robust model performance.
5. **Model Deployment** (Optional):
   - The model can be deployed for real-time predictions using a web application or API.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of **[insert accuracy here]**, indicating its effectiveness in predicting the success of Falcon 9's first stage landing. Insights from the model suggest that certain factors like **[insert key factors, e.g., weather conditions, rocket configuration, etc.]** have a significant impact on the success rate.
