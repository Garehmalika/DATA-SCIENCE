This project focuses on addressing customer churn in the SME segment of a gas and electricity utility company, where market liberalization has led to significant losses in customer retention. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, particularly their sensitivity to price changes, to develop a predictive model that identifies those most likely to switch providers. By utilizing historical customer and pricing data, the project will test key hypotheses, perform exploratory data analysis, and engineer features to improve churn prediction accuracy. The insights from this model will support the development of strategies such as offering targeted discounts to retain at-risk customers, ultimately improving business outcomes.
